### Done:

1. download the dataset ChiKuSei and CAVE
2. preprocess the dataset to generate training data (create_dataset.py, only for CAVE dataset)
3. main.py it has bugs that the loss is always nan. I argue that preprocess (create_dataset.py) code is not suitable for this model. 
(bug is fixed by adding normalization logic in the preprocess code)
4. train the model 

### To-Do:

5. implementing the experiment mentioned in the paper by ourselves cuz the author didn't upload the experiment code.
