### To-Do:
1. (DONE√) download the dataset ChiKuSei and CAVE 
2. (DONE√) preprocess the dataset to generate training data (create_dataset.py, only for CAVE dataset) 
3. (DONE√) main.py it has bugs that the loss is always nan. I argue that preprocess (create_dataset.py) code is not suitable for this model.  (DONE√)
(bug is fixed by adding normalization logic in the preprocess code)
4. (DONE√) training code (defined in main.py)
5. (DONE√) implementing the experiment mentioned in the paper by ourselves cuz the author didn't upload the experiment code. 
6. use other datasets to train and test (Datasets: Cave √ Chikusei × Pavia ×)
